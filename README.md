# AngularNodeNgrx

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.0.

## Development server
Run `node server.js`
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Food Store
This is a very simple app that simulates a food store. It was created to tinker with a simple node API and ngrx. If you click on the cart icon for an item, it will increase the cart counter by 1. It will decrease if you then remove the item.

## TODO
Add a view for the shopping cart.
Expand features to take further advantage of the state management provided by ngrx.
